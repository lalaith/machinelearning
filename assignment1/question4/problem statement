Gaussian Discriminant Analysis

(a) Implement Gaussian Discriminant Analysis using the closed form equations described in
class. Assume that both the classes have the same co-variance matrix. Report the
values of the means, and the co-variance matrix.

(b) Plot the training data corresponding to the two coordinates of the input features, and
you should use a divergerent symbol for each point plotted to indicate whether the label of the example.

(c) Describe the equation of the boundary separating the two regions in terms of the parameters. 
Recall that GDA results in a linear separator when the two classes have identical covariance matrix. 
Along with the data points plotted in the part above, plot (on the same figure)decision boundary fit by GDA.

(d) In general, GDA allows each of the target classes to have its own covariance matrix. This
results (in general) in a quadratic boundary separating the two class regions. Implement GDA for
the above problem in this more general setting. Report the values of the parameter estimates.

(e) Describe the equation for the quadratic boundary separating the two regions in terms of
the parameters. On the graph plotted earlier displaying the data points and the linear separating boundary, 
also plot the quadratic boundary obtained in the previous step.

(f ) Carefully analyse the linear as well as the quadratic boundaries obtained. Comment on
your observations.
