Locally Weighted Linear Regression

(a) Implement (unweighted) linear regression on this dataset (using the normal equations), 
and plot on the same figure the data and the straight line resulting from your fit.

(b) Implement locally weighted linear regression on this dataset (using the weighted normal
equations you derived above), and plot on the same figure the data and the curve resulting from your fit. 
Use a bandwidth parameter tau = 0.8. 

(c) Repeat (b) four times, with tau = 0.1; 0.3; 2 and 10. Which value of tau do you think works
best? Comment on what happens to the fit when tau is too small or too large
